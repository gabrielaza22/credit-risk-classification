REPORT
Overview of the Analysis

Purpose of the analysis.
This analysis was created to evaluate a model and its accuracy in classifying the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using the dataset provided, which includes interest rates, total debt, loan size, and more user information, we will train 
the model to identify the loan risk by classifying it as a healthy or high-risk loan. By obtaining this information, the loan company would have better results in profit and losses.

This model presents 100% precision in classifying healthy loans and 85% correct for high-risk loans. Overall, it performs well, even though the data show an imbalance in the number of healthy loans compared to the risky ones. In the same way, the precision and recall expose optimal results  identifying  the creditworthiness of borrowers and once again rectifying the information previously obtained in the accuracy report.
As the image above shows, the AUC is 99% accurate, suggesting excellent performance. Our choice of model classifies Healthy Loans and High-Risk Loans.


Machine Learning Model 1:
The logistic regression model performs excellently, and it is recommended for a loan risk exercise because it gives proper results and has few false positive and false negative results.
